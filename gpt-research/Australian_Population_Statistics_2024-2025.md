- High rates of drug use among people with psychosis
- Bidirectional relationship: each condition exacerbates the other

### 5.2 Domestic Violence + Mental Health Overlap

**Source:** AIHW FDSV Reports, Australian studies 2024

| Condition/Factor | Association Strength | Details |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------|
| Pre-existing serious mental illness | 2-8x greater DV risk | Psychotic disorders particularly high risk |
| PTSD, panic attacks, depression | Strong association | Commonly co-occur with FDV |
| Chronic substance use | Strong association | Both cause and effect |
| Suicidality | Strongly associated | DV significantly increases risk |
| Eating disorders | Moderately associated | Higher in DV survivors |
| Risky sexual behaviors | Moderately associated | Trauma-related |

**Temporal Patterns:**
- Pre-existing mental illness increases victimization risk (especially by carers/intimate partners)
- DV experience exacerbates existing mental illness
- DV experience increases new suicide attempts
- DV experience increases substance abuse

**Perpetrator Mental Health:**

## 8. DATA GAPS AND ASSUMPTIONS

### 8.1 Data Gaps

1. **Age-Specific Mental Health Rates:**
   - Detailed percentages for ages 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+ not readily available in search results
   - ABS has this data in detailed tables, but not in summary reports
   - **Recommendation:** Access ABS data cubes directly

2. **Domestic Violence Age Breakdown:**
   - Most recent comprehensive age-specific DV data is from 2021-22 Personal Safety Survey
   - No detailed 2024 breakdown by specific age groups
   - Only general statement that 18-34 women have highest rates
   - **Assumption needed:** Apply 2021-22 patterns to 2024-25 model

3. **Exact Population Age Distribution:**
   - Some age groups (45-49, 50-54, etc.) estimated from available data
   - ABS regional data has details but in complex table format
   - **Recommendation:** Download full ABS data tables

4. **Drug Use Among SHS Clients:**
   - General population drug use well documented
   - SHS clients have "problematic drug/alcohol use" (8.6%)
   - Detailed breakdown by substance type only available for dual SHS+AOD treatment clients
   - **Gap:** Drug use rates among ALL SHS clients by substance type

5. **Mental Health Severity:**
   - Data shows prevalence but not severity distribution
   - No clear breakdown of mild vs moderate vs severe
   - **Impact:** May affect homelessness risk modeling

6. **Temporal Dynamics:**
   - Limited data on whether mental health/drug use preceded or followed homelessness
   - Some data for substance use (1/3 before, 2/3 after)
   - **Gap:** Similar timeline data for mental health and DV

7. **Co-occurrence Quantification:**
   - Some specific combinations quantified (e.g., 42% of drug/alcohol clients also have MH)
   - Many other combinations described qualitatively only
   - **Need:** More complete co-occurrence matrix

8. **Housing Types:**
   - Model includes "location" variable
   - Limited data on homelessness risk by specific geographic areas
   - **Gap:** Regional variation in risk factors

9. **Indigenous Sub-populations:**
   - Data aggregates all Indigenous Australians
   - No breakdown by remoteness, community type
   - **Known issue:** Remote communities have different risk profiles

10. **Children vs Adolescents vs Adults:**
    - SHS data includes children (under 18: 27%)
    - Mental health data starts at age 16
    - Drug use data starts at age 14
    - **Gap:** Risk factors for young children (<14) less well documented

### 8.2 Necessary Assumptions

1. **Mental Health Definition Consistency:**
   - General population: "12-month mental disorder" (clinical diagnosis)
   - SHS clients: "current mental health issue" (agency-reported)
   - **Assumption:** These are comparable for modeling purposes
   - **Risk:** May underestimate general population or overestimate SHS

2. **Drug Use Severity:**
   - General population: "12-month use" (any use)
   - SHS clients: "problematic drug/alcohol use"
   - **Assumption:** "Problematic" equates to substance use disorder (3.3% general pop)
   - **Alternative:** Use higher threshold (11.5% any illicit use)
   - **Recommendation:** Use 8.6% as-is since it's specific to at-risk population

3. **Age Group Boundaries:**
   - Data sources use different age brackets
   - SHS: "under 18" vs ABS: "0-14" and "15-19"
   - **Assumption:** Align as closely as possible, note discrepancies
   - **For model:** May need to standardize to 5-year bands

4. **Indigenous Population Growth:**
   - Latest official estimate: 3.8% (June 2021)
   - Current date: October 2025
   - **Assumption:** Still approximately 3.8-4.0% in 2024-25
   - **Justification:** Population projections show slow growth to 4.0-4.2% by 2031

5. **DV Temporal Patterns:**
   - 2021-22 Personal Safety Survey is most recent comprehensive source
   - 2024 domestic homicide data available
   - **Assumption:** 2021-22 patterns still apply in 2024-25
   - **Justification:** DV rates increased 2022-2023, so using 2021-22 is conservative

6. **Geographic Uniformity:**
   - Most statistics are national averages
   - Model includes location variable
   - **Assumption:** National rates apply reasonably across major cities and regions
   - **Known limitation:** Remote areas differ significantly

7. **Binary Risk Factors:**
   - Model uses binary variables (True/False) for mental health, drug use
   - Reality: these are continuous/severity spectrums
   - **Assumption:** Binary classification sufficient for at-risk prediction
   - **For IPF:** Use prevalence rates as probabilities

8. **Independence of Some Factors:**
   - For IPF, may need to assume some conditional independence
   - Known reality: many factors strongly correlated
   - **Recommendation:** Use multi-way tables where co-occurrence data exists
   - **Where data missing:** Apply independence assumption cautiously

9. **Stable Rates During 2024-25:**
   - Data from 2020-2023 surveys
   - **Assumption:** Rates haven't changed dramatically in 2024-25
   - **Justification:** Most trends show gradual change, not sudden shifts
   - **Exception:** Mental health in youth showed rapid increase 2017-2021, may have stabilized

10. **Education and Employment Proxies:**
    - Model includes these variables
    - No specific statistics compiled in this report
    - **Assumption:** Can derive from broader ABS labor force and education statistics
    - **Need:** Separate data collection for these variables

### 8.3 Recommended Next Steps

1. **Access Detailed ABS Data Cubes:**
   - Mental health by 10-year age bands
   - Population by single-year ages
   - Can provide more precise inputs

2. **Review Personal Safety Survey 2021-22:**
   - Full dataset has detailed age-by-DV crosstabs
   - Would fill age-specific DV gap

3. **Consult AIHW Data Cubes:**
   - SHS Client Collection has detailed multi-way tables
   - Can derive more precise co-occurrence rates

4. **Education/Employment Statistics:**
   - Access ABS Labour Force Survey
   - Access ABS Education statistics
   - Align with age/gender/Indigenous status

5. **Income Source Statistics:**
   - ABS income surveys
   - Centrelink payment statistics
   - Align with demographics

6. **Validate Co-occurrence Assumptions:**
   - Where data exists, check if independence assumptions hold
   - Use actual joint distributions where available
   - Document where independence is assumed

7. **Consider Sensitivity Analysis:**
   - Given data gaps, test model with different assumptions
   - Particularly for co-occurrence rates
   - Identify which assumptions most impact outputs

8. **Regional Variation:**
   - If model will be used regionally, gather state/territory specific data
   - AIHW and ABS provide state breakdowns
   - Major cities vs regional vs remote patterns differ

### 8.4 Data Quality Notes

**Strengths:**
- ABS and AIHW are authoritative, gold-standard sources
- Recent data (2020-2024)
- Large sample sizes (NSMHW: representative sample; SHS: full census of services)
- Consistent methodologies across time

**Limitations:**
- Self-report bias (particularly for illicit drug use, DV)
- Potential undercount of most marginalized populations
- Different definitions across datasets
- Time lags (most recent mental health data is 2020-22)
- Indigenous population undercount in census

**Confidence Levels:**
- High confidence: Overall prevalence rates for mental health, drug use, DV
- High confidence: SHS client characteristics and counts
- Medium confidence: Specific co-occurrence rates (some data, some inference)
- Medium confidence: Age-specific rates beyond what's explicitly published
- Lower confidence: Temporal ordering of risk factors and homelessness
